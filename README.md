# Video resumer

This extension automatically resumes the video you were watching when you last closed the tab.

Addons.mozilla.org link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/videoresumer/

I made this extension because https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-resumer does not work on Android. (It is marked as "Compatible with Firefox for Android", but it does not actually resume videos on YouTube.com on Android. This extension /does/ work on YouTube.com and Android.)
